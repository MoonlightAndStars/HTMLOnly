<!-- attributes - we place attribute right after the opening tag. attributes are of two types. 1 Global 2 Custom
 
1 - Global Attribute - Global Attributes are the attributes which we can use on all html element - eg - style, hidden (we don't need to give value on this) title (when we hover over it then it shows whatever we have written in title. it is known as tool tip) 

There are few attributes which directly do not have any effect on our website and two of the most commonly used attributes are class and id. 

data-(anything) - we use in javascript

2 - Custom Attribute - we can write anything we want and it can be used as an attribute. it can be used for css and javascript but it does not hold any specific meaning in html.
