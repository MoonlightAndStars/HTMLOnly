<!-- input type can be either text or search when we are searching for something and if we use search as an input type the browser automatically adds a cross sign as soon as we enter anything and clicking the cross symbol resets the input field-->

<!-- also the input type submit and value search on google works in a similar way as button>Search on Amazon  -->

<!-- ERROR
 
SyntaxError: Unexpected closing tag "p". It may happen when the tag has already been closed by another tag. For more info see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#closing-elements-that-have-implied-end-tags (18:17)

in my code prettier is throwing this error
The error you're encountering is due to improper nesting of HTML tags. Specifically, the <p> tag is being closed prematurely or incorrectly. In HTML, certain tags like <div> cannot be nested inside a <p> tag because the <p> tag automatically closes when it encounters a block-level element like <div>.

In your code, the <div> inside the <p> tag is causing the issue. To fix this, you can either:

Remove the <div> inside the <p> tag, or

Replace the <p> tag with a <div> or another appropriate block-level element.
    
*This error happened because p was containing div inside it.-->
